# work-day-scheduler
The goal of this project is to create a work day planner that allows users to save tasks for each hour of the day.

##
-When a user opens the calendar they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours.  
-When a user selects a time block they can input a task, and after selecting the save button, the data is saved in local storage.
